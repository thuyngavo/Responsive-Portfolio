        <p>Hello! I am Lisa Vo. I am born in California and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. No, I do not listen to country music and I only like BBQ 50% of the time. Since I was young have always been excited to learn about the internet and how it works. After graduating with a bacholars in business, I attended three years of lawa school. During my final year, I was not happy with the experience and decided to give coding a chance. After applying to the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, I finally had a chance to learn a skill I was always interested in.</p>

        <p>Along with 3 years of office services experience, I have 2.5 years of legal assistant experience and successfully completed 3 years of law school. My specialization in in ligitation and collection.</p>

        <p>I am currently building my skills in this field to help develop something everyone can enjoy. I cant wait to see how much I can grow and what I can create with the opportunity this program has given me. Trust me. This is so much more fun than law school. </p>
